# Water Module
This is the repository for Chapter 10 of Global Development: Poverty, Inequality, and the Politics of Data Policy Research Project (PRP). The dataset and code required to complete the Water Module is found here.

# Abstract
The purpose of this data module is to provide students with the analytical tools to explore various water datasets. We will explore how to conceptualize, research, and visualize common water indicators. In doing so, our mission is to uncover how these indicators can be misused or misinterpreted. The module will be split into two sections. Section one will focus on exploring WHO / UNICEF JMP and World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct data and methodology. Students will learn how to find, download, and read the data and methodology. We will ask critical questions surrounding the metadata and guide participants to use the tools and analyses provided in Chapter 10’s manuscript to answer corresponding questions. Section two of the module will teach students to produce their own visualizations in excel. These visualizations will include research level maps illustrating water access and stress. This data module will encourage students to reflect on biases, capacity, and accountability challenges discussed in section four of the chapter.

# Data Sources
The data module uses data from the WHO / UNICEF Joint-Monitoring Programme (JMP) and the World Resources Institute (WRI). The JMP measures water, sanitation, and hygiene coverage and provides data for SDG 3 and SDG 6. This module will focus exclusively on water. While the WRI Aqueduct data provides a ranking for countries experiencing water stress.
