# Water Module
This is the repository for Chapter 10 of Global Development: Poverty, Inequality, and the Politics of Data Policy Research Project (PRP). The dataset and code required to complete the Water Module is found here.

# Abstract
The purpose of this data module is to provide students with the analytical tools to explore various water datasets. We will explore how to conceptualize, research, and visualize common water indicators. In doing so, our mission is to uncover how these indicators can be misused, misinterpreted, or missing.  The module will be split into two sections. Section one will focus on exploring WHO / UNICEF JMP and World Resources Institute Aqueduct Data and methodology. Students will learn how to find, download, and read the data and methodology. We will ask critical questions surrounding the metadata and guide participants to use the tools and analyses provided in Chapter 10’s manuscript to answer corresponding questions. To check for knowledge, we will provide a visualization based on both data sets and ask students to interpret the findings and critique the visualization. Section two of the module, will teach students how to produce their own data visualizations. We will use JMP WASH data and WRI’s Aqueduct dataset, provided in the github repository. Students will practice working as a data analyst and gaining first hand experience using excel for high-level data visualizations. In particular we will teach students to make research level maps of water stress and access through excel.

# Data Sources
The data module uses data from the WHO / UNICEF Joint-Monitoring Programme (JMP) and the World Resources Institute (WRI). The JMP measures water, sanitation, and hygiene coverage and provides data for SDG 3 and SDG 6. This module will focus exclusively on water. While the WRI Aqueduct data provides a ranking for countries experiencing water stress.
